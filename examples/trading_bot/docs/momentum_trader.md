> **Disclaimer:** The code in this binary is for demonstration purposes only. It is intended to illustrate the usage of the `nyks-wallet` SDK and should not be considered a complete, production-ready trading strategy. The logic is simplified and may not perform as expected in a live trading environment.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Momentum Trader Bot, detailing its trading strategy, technical indicators, configuration, and ZkOS-compliant operational procedures.

## üìú Overview

The Momentum Trader Bot is an automated trading strategy that aims to capitalize on market trends. It uses a combination of technical indicators to identify the direction and strength of market momentum and executes trades accordingly.

## üéØ Strategy Overview

The bot's strategy is based on the following principles:

- **Trend Identification**: It uses a combination of Fast and Slow Moving Averages (MA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to determine the market trend (Bullish, Bearish, or Sideways).
- **Signal Strength**: It calculates a "signal strength" to quantify the confidence in a trading signal. A trade is only initiated if the signal strength exceeds a configurable threshold.
- **Dynamic Leverage**: The leverage for a position is dynamically adjusted based on the signal strength‚Äîstronger signals result in higher leverage, up to a defined maximum.
- **Risk Management**: Each position is protected by a predefined stop-loss and take-profit level, which are calculated as a percentage of the entry price.
- **Position Management**: The bot will only hold one position at a time. It continuously monitors the market to determine the optimal time to exit a position, either due to a stop-loss, take-profit, or a reversal in the market signal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

To run the momentum trader bot, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin momentum_trader -- [OPTIONS]
```

## üîÑ ZkOS Compliance and Account Lifecycle

The Momentum Trader Bot is fully compliant with ZkOS, particularly in its management of trading accounts to prevent common errors.

### Account Initialization

1.  A **master trading account** is created with the full `initial_capital`.
2.  The master account is then **split** into multiple smaller accounts (currently fixed at 3) to facilitate position rotation.

### Trading Account Lifecycle Flow

The bot follows a strict account lifecycle:

1.  **Account Selection**: To open a new position, the bot selects an available account that is in the `IOType::Coin` state and has a positive balance.
2.  **Order Placement**: A `MARKET` order is placed using the **full balance** of the chosen account. The account's state transitions from `Coin` to `Memo`.
3.  **Position Monitoring**: Once the order is `FILLED`, the bot monitors the position for exit conditions (stop-loss, take-profit, or signal reversal).
4.  **Position Closing**: When an exit condition is met, a `MARKET` order is sent to close the position.
5.  **Position Settlement**: After the closing order is `SETTLED`, the account is ready for rotation.
6.  **Account Rotation**: The settled account is "rotated" using `trading_to_trading`, which creates a new, fresh account containing the proceeds from the trade. This new account is then returned to the pool of available accounts.
7.  **Order Cancellation**: If an order is `CANCELLED`, the account does not need rotation and is immediately returned to the available accounts pool.

This process ensures that a fresh account is used for every new position, adhering to ZkOS's account management rules.
