### Supported Strategies

You can choose from one of the following trading strategies:

- `mean-reversion`
- `arbitrage`
- `market-making`

## üîÑ Account Initialization

The bot automates the setup of the necessary trading accounts:

1.  A **main trading account** is created and funded with 50% of the `initial_capital`.
2.  A **hedge account** is created and funded with 25% of the `initial_capital` for risk management purposes.

## üåê Real-Time Market Data Integration

The bot is capable of integrating real-time market data from the Relayer API, which is crucial for making informed trading decisions. This includes:

- **BTC/USD Price**: For accurate, real-time pricing.
- **Order Book**: To analyze market depth and spreads.
- **Recent Trades**: To gauge market activity and volume.

The system is designed with robust error handling, including fallbacks to simulated data if the live data feed is interrupted. For more details on the market data integration, refer to the `test_market_data` binary and its documentation.
